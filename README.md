# Initial Version of my NixOS configuration

This is where it begins. This version will only contain the current config and hardware config from /etc/nixos

This is a very simple config without the use flakes or home manager yet.

This config can be run with: "sudo nixos-rebuild switch -I nixos-config=/PATH_TO/configuration.nix"
